This README file concerns the FVS project only.

FVS is written in C and uses data encapsulation and object oriented
programming techniques so that porting to C++ or other object oriented
languages becomes easier.

Once compiled, the libfvs library functions can be used to create
other programs based on it. Both the static and dynamic libraries
are generated.

Fingerprint images may be found in the Internet at various places if
you don't have a fingerprint scanner. On the FVS homepage you will
also find a ZIP file containing many bitmaps for testing purposes.




SOME DEMO PROGRAMS
------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fvs_enhancer is a fingerprint enhancer program that demonstrates how to
use the library to enhance a fingerprint image. The source image and the
destination image are both bitmaps. The first stage of the library, the
enhancement is the only one that works well and is completely useable.
We are currently working on the other stages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fvs_direction is a demonstration that takes a fingerprint image as input.
This fingerprint image should be normalized for best resuts. The output
of this program is another image containing a direction field and the
original fingerprint image in the background.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fvs_createtestimages is a program that generates a few bitmaps that may be
used for debugging purposes. It generates images with stripes in different
directions and different spacings. The filename is build following the
principles:
    testimgSSSDDD.bmp
where SSS represents the spacing in pixels between two lines and
where DDD represents the direction in degrees.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fvs_thinner demonstrates how to obtain a thinned image from a fingerprint
image. The thinned image should represent as close as possible the ridge
profile of the fingerprint.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fvs_minutia shows how to get the minutia out of a fingerprint image. This
part still needs some work in order to work well. Many minutia are detected
where only a few are really true minutia. Some more hours are needed in
the algorithmic here...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fvs_mask displays the region of interest mask that is computed around a
fingerprint image. This part lacks still some features... A structural
operator should eliminate holes in the mask and we should also remove the
border of the fingerprint as minutia in this region cannot be good to use.



BUILDING THE SOURCE
-------------------



when in the project directory type
  ./configure
  make
  make install

you need a working compiler, make and linker as well as up to date
autoconf and automake. Make install will install all in the default
prefix /usr/local. If you want to install FVS into another library,
use the --prefix parameter when running the configure script. See
./configure --help for more details about what options are suppported.


The documentation may be generated with doxygen. In the doc subdirectory
type in

  cd ./doc
  doxygen

and it will be generated in subdirectories of ./doc
